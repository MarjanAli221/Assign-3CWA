        <h2>Fully Responsive Webpage</h2>
        <p>This webpage was designed to be viewable on mobile devices. Used css media rule to define custom attributes for smaller screens. The Home page changes layout on a mobile screen but the other pages mostly retain it's structure.
      Manually defined attributes for a lot of elements to make the texts and photos appear more natural on a mobile device.  It was optimised for for modern mobile phone screens. 
      This page is optimised for tablets, i.e., separate size values  defined for tablet screens. Source <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp">click to visit the source page</a>

        <h2>Automatic Image Slider </h2>
        <p> Displayed automatic slideshow on the home page. Images are continously sliding within the set time limit. I used four images for this 
                slideshow. Used the animation attribiute & the keyframe in the style.css to crreate the automatic slide show.Source <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_slideshow.asp">click to visit the source page</a>
